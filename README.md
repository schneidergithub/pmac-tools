This is a JSON jira importer example.  It was entirely created by "vibe-coding" with a conbo of Claude 3.7, chatGPT 4o and old-fashioned brain power. I would say it got 90% there, but the last 10% is annoying.

What's particularly interesting is the code it made for "self-healing", where it attempts to reformat the concept of epic & story into different naming conventions to preserve relationships.  It manages to find a decent solution, although inefficient.
